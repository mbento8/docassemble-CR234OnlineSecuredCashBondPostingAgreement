  Online bail payments can be made with a VISA or MasterCard credit card or debit card. You cannot pay with an American Express or Discover card.

  Each credit card transaction will be assessed a 3% convenience fee. If/when bail is later returned (exonerated) to the payer, the fee will not be returned.

  If bail is more than $97,000, the person posting bail must make more than one payment until the total amount paid equals the total of bail. For example, if bail is $250,000, make three payments: Payment 1 = $95,000 + 3% fee, Payment 2 = $95,000 + 3% fee, and Payment 3= $60,000 + 3% fee. A single payment cannot exceed $99,999 including the 3% convenience fee.
